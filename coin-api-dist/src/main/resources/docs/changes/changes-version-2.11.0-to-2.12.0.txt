The following property have been added to coin-api.properties:
-------
#which SAML attribute holds the UUID
saml-uuid-attribute=urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.1076.20.40.40.1
-------

It's value belongs to the category: "The following properties are the responsibility of the developers"

On every environment, but localhost it's value will be urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.1076.20.40.40.1. Only when testing locally against Mujina we need the flexibility to choose a different SAML attribute for the unique identifier. In all coin-api.properties.env properties files the value is correct.
